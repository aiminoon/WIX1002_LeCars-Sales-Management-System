# LeCars Sales Management System
Welcome to the LeCars Sales Management System project, a car sales management platform developed by the IntLocJava team for the WIX1002 Fundamentals of Programming course at the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Malaya.

## Project Overview
The LeCars Sales Management System is a command-line interface (CLI) program built using Java, designed to simulate and manage a car sales business. It provides features for handling inventory, sales transactions, customer data, and reporting using appropriate data structures such as arrays, ArrayLists, queues, stacks, and hash tables.

## Features
1. Car Inventory Management
- Display All Cars: Show all available cars with details such as brand, model, year, and price.
- Add New Cars: Add new vehicles to the inventory with proper input validation.
- Update Car Information: Modify details of existing cars (e.g., price, status).
- Remove Cars: Remove cars from the inventory based on ID or model.

2. Customer Records
- Customer Registration: Register new customers with name, contact, and purchase history.
- Search Customer: Search customer details using name or contact number.
- View Purchase History: Track and display customer's past car purchases.

3. Sales Transaction Handling
- Sell a Car: Process a car sale including car selection, customer linking, and updating inventory.
- Generate Receipt: Provide a summary receipt post-purchase.
- Sales Queue: Use a queue data structure to manage customers waiting to purchase.

4. Reporting and Statistics
- Daily Sales Report: Track number of sales and revenue for the day.
- Top Customers: Identify top buyers based on purchase volume.
- Stock Summary: View number of cars available per brand or type.

5. Undo Feature
- Stack Implementation: Utilize a stack to undo the most recent car-related action (e.g., delete, update).

6. Search and Filter Cars
- Dynamic Search: Filter inventory based on price range, brand, year, or status (available/sold).
- Hash Table Lookup: Use hash tables for quick car or customer lookup based on unique IDs.

## Technical Stack
- Language: Java
- Development Environment: IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Apache Netbeans
- Data Structures Used: ArrayList, Queue, Stack, HashMap
- UI Type: Console-based (CLI)

## Conclusion
The LeCars Sales Management System reflects our grasp of fundamental programming concepts and object-oriented principles. By simulating a real-world car sales environment, we applied practical skills in transaction tracking, queue operations, and file handling. This project also strengthened our collaborative development experience and provided a solid foundation for structured problem-solving using Java.
